# User Guide

Welcome to Jovay! This guide is for users who want to connect to the Jovay network, move assets, and explore its growing ecosystem.

Jovay is a high-performance Layer 2 network built on Ethereum. It offers faster transactions, lower fees, and a secure environment for a wide range of decentralized applications (DApps).

## Getting Started: Your Jovay Wallet
To interact with Jovay, you need a web3 wallet like MetaMask. The first step is to add the Jovay network to your wallet.

### Add Jovay to MetaMask
Follow these steps to add Jovay to your wallet's list of networks:

1. Open MetaMask and click on the network dropdown at the top.
2. Select "Add network".
3. Choose "Add a network manually".
4. Fill in the details for the network you wish to add (Mainnet for real assets, Testnet for testing).

Use the information from the table below:

| Configuration | Jovay Mainnet | Jovay Testnet |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Network Name** | `Jovay Mainnet` | `Jovay Testnet` |
| **RPC URL** | `https://rpc.jovay.io` | `https://api.zan.top/public/jovay-testnet` |
| **Chain ID** | `5734951` | `2019775` |
| **Currency Symbol** | `ETH` | `ETH` |
| **Block Explorer URL** | `https://explorer.jovay.io` | `https://sepolia-explorer.jovay.io/l2` |


After saving, you can easily switch to the Jovay network from your wallet's network list.

## Bridging Assets with the Jovay Bridge
To use DApps on Jovay, you'll need to move assets like ETH from the Ethereum mainnet to Jovay. This is done using a "bridge."

The official and easiest way to do this is with the **Jovay Bridge DApp**.

**➡️** **[Launch the Jovay Bridge DApp](https://bridge.jovay.io)**

### How it Works:
+ **Depositing to Jovay**: You send assets from your Ethereum wallet to the bridge, and an equivalent amount appears in your wallet on the Jovay network.
+ **Withdrawing from Jovay**: You initiate a withdrawal on the Jovay network, and after a security period, you can claim your assets back on the Ethereum network.

For a complete walkthrough, please see the [Jovay Bridge DApp Tutorial](./jovay-bridge-dapp-tutorial.md).
