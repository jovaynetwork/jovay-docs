# Jovay EVM Compatibility
This document outlines the key similarities and differences between the Jovay EVM on the testnet and the Ethereum EVM, specifically in comparison to the Prague version. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for developers building and deploying smart contracts on the Jovay network.

## Key Differences with Ethereum EVM (Prague Version)
Though Jovay prioritizes a high degree of compatibility with the Ethereum EVM, its current testnet implementation diverges in several key aspects, notably due to differences in current design choices. These distinctions are largely transparent to most DApp developers, but awareness is crucial when leveraging specific features impacted by these underlying differences.

### Opcode Differences

| Opcode  | Solidity syntax   | Behavior on Jovay   |
|--       |--                 |--                   |
|COINBASE |block.coinbase     | Return the recipient address for the block fees.  |
|PREVRANDAO |block.prevrandao     | Returns `0`. Currently, Jovay does not support providing pseudo-random numbers via `prevrandao`.  |
|BASEFEE |block.basefee     | The base fee is configured by a system contract. In Ethereum, the base fee is dynamically and automatically set based on block size changes.  |
|BLOBBASEFEE |block.blobbasefee     | Returns `0`. EIP-4844 is not currently supported.  |
|BLOBHASH |block.blobhash(blobIndex)    | Returns `0`. EIP-4844 is not currently supported.  |
| BLOCKHASH |  blockhash(block.number)  | Returns the keccak256 hash of a block number, where the input to the hash is the block number in decimal string format. |

### Precompiled Contract Differences
The following precompiled contract address has a different implementation on the Jovay testnet.
