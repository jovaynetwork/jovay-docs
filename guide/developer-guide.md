# Developer Guide

Welcome to the Jovay developer documentation. To provide a clearer and more focused learning path, we have organized our quickstart guides into two main sections.



Please choose the guide that best fits your needs:

---

### 📖 Developer Quickstart
New to Jovay? Start here. This guide covers the essentials of setting up your environment, acquiring testnet funds, and deploying your first smart contract on the Jovay network.

### 🚰 Get Testnet Tokens
If you need some ETH on the Jovay Testnet to pay for transaction fees, you can get it for free from the ZAN Faucet.
