# Jovay Terms of Service
**Version Number: 1.00**

**Last Updated: 25 September 2025**

**<u>IMPORTANT NOTICE</u>: BY ACCESSING, INTERACTING WITH OR USING ANY OF THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO ENTER INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT AND, AS SUCH, HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN SECTION 12. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY PART OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO INTERACT WITH, ACCESS OR USE ANY SERVICE, INTERFACE OR FEATURE.**

Jovay is a layer 2 protocol that integrates both trusted execution environment (TEE) rollup and zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup (“**Jovay**”) that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Jovay Labs Company Limited (“**Jovay Labs**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”) makes available certain blockchain protocol, software, and technology services (which, together with the technology services described in section 1 and elsewhere in this Agreement, are collectively referred to herein as the “**Services**”) that enable users and developers to access and interact with Jovay and related resources, tools, and applications. The Services may be accessed via https://jovay.io (“**Site**”), developer application programming interfaces (“**APIs**”), command-line tools, software development kits (“**SDKs**”), graphical user interfaces, and other electronic platforms or integration methods.

The Services enable users to (whether by itself or with the assistance of third party service providers), among other things: (i) submit, broadcast, and confirm transactions on Jovay; (ii) deploy, call, and interact with smart contracts hosted on the Jovay network; (iii) bridge Digital Assets between Ethereum, Jovay, and other supported networks using Jovay Bridge; (iv) leverage developer tooling, including artificial intelligence-assisted contract auditing, simulation, and optimization functions; and (v) perform other blockchain-based activities supported by the Protocol as we may make available from time to time.

These Terms of Service (“**Terms**,” “**Terms of Service**,” or “**Agreement**”) constitute a legally binding contract between you (or the person you represent) (“**you**” or “**your**”) and us that governs your access to and use of the Services.

By (i) using the Services or the Site; (ii) clicking a button, ticking a checkbox or using any other method to accept or agree to this Agreement where that option is made available; and/or (iii) clicking a button or taking any other action to use or access any of the Services (the earliest date on which any of the aforementioned events occurs being the “**Effective Date**”), you (a) accept and agree to this Agreement and any additional terms that apply to certain additional services, rules, and conditions of participation published by us from time to time and (b) consent to the collection, use, disclosure, and other handling of information as described in our Privacy Policy. It is the intention of the parties that acceptance of this Agreement shall be deemed to be as valid as an original and duly authorized signature and/or company seal/chop (as applicable) being applied to this Agreement. 

By using the Services, you irrevocably acknowledge and agree that we are merely a technology services provider and do not operate as a bank, broker, custodian, investment adviser, fiduciary or other financial or other intermediary. Any interaction with Jovay is executed by you or by smart contracts or applications you authorize. We do not have control over, or responsibility for, Digital Assets, smart contracts, or other blockchain-based systems you may use in connection with the Services, and we do not guarantee the availability, security, or functionality of any third party software, hardware, networks, or resources.

You acknowledge that use of the Services involves inherent technological and operational risks, including potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts, variability in transaction processing times, and the possibility of Protocol upgrades or changes in proof systems, including migration from trusted execution environments (“**TEEs**”) to zero-knowledge proofs (“**ZKPs**”). You are solely responsible for evaluating these risks before engaging in any activity through or relating to the Services.

We provide technology and infrastructure services only. We do not make any representation, warranty, or guarantee regarding the suitability of any Digital Assets or application accessible through the Protocol. Nothing in this Agreement constitutes, or should be construed as, financial, investment, legal, or other professional advice.

You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts. If you are entering into this Agreement for another person, such as the person you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that person.

Please see section 14 for definitions of certain capitalized and other terms used in this Agreement.

## 1	Description of the Services
### 1.1	Site
We operate a website (the Site) and graphical user display that renders information about functions and performance of the Services. You understand that the information displayed on the Site is stored and publicly available on the internet. We provide the Site only for your convenience, do not have control over any Third Party Content appearing therein, and do not warrant or endorse, nor bear responsibility for the availability or legitimacy of, the content on or accessible from the Site. When viewing the Site, you should assume that we have not verified the safety or legitimacy of, any content, resources, interactive features, or links appearing on the Site. It is your responsibility to ensure that you fully understand the nature of any links or other interactive features that you may be able to access on the Site, including any financial and other risks that you may be exposed to when interacting with Third Party Services. The Site may include additional functions or features as they are developed from time to time.

### 1.2	Jovay and Jovay Bridge
Jovay includes protocol smart contracts that allow you to “bridge” (i.e., lock assets on one blockchain protocol and replicate them on another protocol) Digital Assets between Jovay, Ethereum and/or other blockchains (“**Jovay Bridge**”).

In addition to the Jovay Bridge, there are other cross-chain solutions available on Jovay which are  operated through the use of certain open source software such as [Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (“**CCIP**”)].  The CCIP bridge is a set of smart contracts deployed to Jovay which are not controlled by Jovay or Jovay Labs. For the avoidance of doubt, the CCIP bridge is not part of the Services.

We do not control what third parties may build on Jovay, the activity of such parties, any user transacting on Jovay, or any data stored on Jovay itself, and we do not take possession, custody, or control over any virtual currency or other Digital Asset on Jovay or Jovay Bridge, unless expressly stated in a written contract signed by Jovay Labs. You acknowledge and agree that we make no representations or warranties with respect to Jovay Bridge, and that, if you use Jovay Bridge, you do so at your own risk.

### 1.3	Interface and Protocol
The Jovay web interface (“**Interface**”) facilitates your ability to access Jovay. The protocol is public, permissionless, and operates through open-source, self-executing smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain (“**Protocol**”). The Interface is distinct from the Protocol. The Interface provides one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. The Protocol enables users to perform various activities, including processing Ethereum transactions with the objective of improved efficiency, bridging Digital Assets across supported networks, and interacting with smart contract-based applications (“**dApps**”). The Interface, on the other hand, enables you to submit messages and transactions to the Protocol, such as bridging Digital Assets between Ethereum, Jovay, and other supported blockchains.

## 2	Using the Services
### 2.1	Accessing the Services
To access the Services, Protocol, Interface or Jovay Bridge you may be required to connect a compatible Wallet, which also enables access to the Interface by constructing and broadcasting the transactions that allow you to interact with the Protocol. Your relationship with any given Wallet provider is governed solely by the applicable terms of that Wallet provider, not this Agreement. No Wallet is created, operated, maintained, or otherwise controlled by us, and we do not have custody or control over the contents of your Wallet, including your Digital Assets and private key. We cannot retrieve, freeze, or transfer the contents of your Wallet.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any private key associated with your Wallet and are fully responsible for any and all messages or conduct signed with your private key. We accept no responsibility or liability to you in connection with your use of any Wallet, and make no representations and warranties regarding how the Services, Protocol, Interface, or Jovay Bridge will operate or be compatible with any specific Wallet. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to prohibit certain Wallet addresses from being able to use or engage in transactions from using the Services.

You hereby unconditionally and irrevocably grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free license to use Your Content for the purpose of providing or operating the Services for so long as we provide or operate the Services.

### 2.2	License to the Services

To use any parts of the contents of the Services other than for personal and non-commercial use, you must seek our permission in writing. We reserve the right to refuse permission without providing any reasons. You acknowledge and agree that nothing set forth in this Agreement shall be construed as a sale, assignment or transfer from (i) us or any of our Affiliates to (ii) you or any of your Affiliates of any ownership interests or rights in or to the Services or any intellectual property rights.

The Services are intended for your internal use only. The rights granted to you in this Agreement are subject to the following restrictions:

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(f)	except as expressly stated herein, no part of the Services may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted, or transmitted in any form or by any means;</div><br>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(g)	you shall not remove or destroy any copyright notices or other proprietary markings contained on or in the Services; and</div><br>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(h)	any future release, update, or other addition to the Services shall be subject to this Agreement.</div>

We, our suppliers and service providers reserve all rights not granted in this section. Any unauthorized use of the Services may result in the immediate termination of any and all licenses, consents or permissions granted pursuant to this Agreement.

If you provide any Suggestions to us or our Affiliates, we and our Affiliates will be entitled to use the Suggestions without restriction.

Any dealings you have with third parties while using the Services, including if a Third Party Service may have infringed your intellectual property rights, are between you and that third party.

No communication or information (including Third Party Content) provided to you by us is intended as, or shall be considered or construed as, investment advice, financial advice, trading advice, or any other form of advice. For the avoidance of doubt, any links, frames, in-app browsers or other connectivity to Third Party Services (including decentralized exchanges and decentralized applications) are provided solely for your convenience, information, and reference only. They do not constitute and shall not be regarded or construed as constituting any offer, solicitation, recommendation, endorsement or advice by us to acquire, dispose of, subscribe for, underwrite, or otherwise deal in any Digital Assets or other assets, investments, instruments, products, or services. We do not arrange, negotiate, intermediate, execute, or clear transactions for you, and we do not provide investment, financial, legal, tax, or other advice. You must make your own independent decisions and obtain your own professional advice as you consider appropriate.

If you access or use a staking service, a third party may stake certain Digital Assets on your behalf, acting as a transaction validator on the applicable blockchain network. If a block of transactions is successfully validated, a reward is granted by that network. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for your use of any staking service and shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with such service. In particular, we are not responsible in any way for any failure by any supported blockchain network to transfer rewards (including any risks of “slashing”) or for the loss, destruction, or transfer of rewards to the incorrect Wallet address.

**THE RISK DISCLOSURES ABOVE ARE NOT EXHAUSTIVE. YOU MUST CONDUCT YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE AND SEEK PROFESSIONAL ADVICE TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION.**

## 12	Governing Law, Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.

### 12.1	Governing Law
This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (“Hong Kong”) without regard to any choice or conflict of laws rules.

### 12.2	Agreement to Submit to Arbitration
To the extent permitted by law, you agree to waive your rights to any jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against us or relating in any way to this Agreement, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“**Notice**”) to us by email at info@jovay.io. The Notice must:

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(a)	include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number;</div><br>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(b)	describe the nature and basis of the claim; and</div><br>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(c)	state the specific relief sought.</div>

Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and us cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after such Notice is received, then either party may then submit the dispute to binding arbitration as prescribed below.

Any dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof or any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (“**HKIAC**”) under the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules in force when the arbitration is commenced.

You and we agree that:

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(a)	this section is governed by Hong Kong law;</div><br>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(b)	the seat of arbitration will be Hong Kong;</div><br>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(c)	unless you and we agree otherwise, the number of arbitrators will be one (1) and that arbitrator must have relevant legal and technological expertise;</div><br>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(d)	if you and we do not agree on the arbitrator to be appointed within 15 working days of the dispute proceeding to arbitration, the arbitrator shall be appointed by HKIAC;</div><br>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(e)	the arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not: (i) consolidate more than one individual’s claims; (ii) preside over any type of class or representative proceeding; or (iii) preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual; and</div><br>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(f)	the arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English.</div>

Any claim to be brought by you arising out of or related to this Agreement must commence arbitration proceedings strictly within one (1) year after such claim arises, failing which it shall be irrevocably time barred. Time-barred claims means that there is no longer any lawful right to assert such claims nor to commence any formal legal action.

You shall maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, you agree that we have the right to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) or equitable relief in any jurisdiction.

You agree that any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement:

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(a)	is personal to you and us; and</div><br>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(b)	will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.</div>

If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason:

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(a)	only the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed/deleted;</div><br>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(b)	severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision should have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and</div><br>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(c)	to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims should be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</div>
